# TODO-015: Fix Security Vulnerability - Path Traversal

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-08-01)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Effort**: 1 hour  
**Category**: Security  
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Security tests added

## üìã Summary

Fix path traversal vulnerability in example tools that could allow unauthorized file system access through malicious file paths containing ".." segments.

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ Path validation function created
2. ‚úÖ All file operations validate paths
3. ‚úÖ Security tests verify protection
4. ‚úÖ No regression in functionality

## üìù Implementation Details

### Files Created:
- ‚úÖ `examples/utils/path_security.rs` - Path validation module
- ‚úÖ `tests/security_test.rs` - Security vulnerability tests

### Files Modified:
- ‚úÖ `examples/utils/mod.rs` - Added path_security module
- ‚úÖ `examples/utils/legacy_tools.rs` - Updated read_file to use path validation
- ‚úÖ `examples/utils/example_tools.rs` - Updated cat tool to use path validation

### Security Fix Implementation:

```rust
pub fn validate_path(path: &str, allowed_dir: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf> {
    let requested = Path::new(path);
    let full_path = if requested.is_relative() {
        allowed_dir.join(requested)
    } else {
        requested.to_path_buf()
    };
    
    // Canonicalize to resolve any .. segments
    let canonical = full_path.canonicalize()
        .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("Invalid path '{}': {}", path, e))?;
    
    let allowed_canonical = allowed_dir.canonicalize()
        .map_err(|_| anyhow::anyhow!("Invalid allowed directory"))?;
    
    // Ensure the canonical path is within allowed directory
    if !canonical.starts_with(&allowed_canonical) {
        bail!("Path traversal attempt detected: '{}'", path);
    }
    
    Ok(canonical)
}
```

## üß™ Test Coverage

Created comprehensive security tests that verify:
1. Normal file access works correctly
2. Path traversal attempts are blocked:
   - `../../../etc/passwd`
   - `/etc/passwd` 
   - `./../../sensitive.txt`
   - Complex paths with multiple `..` segments

## üîí Security Impact

- **Before**: Tools could read any file on the system if given malicious paths
- **After**: All file access is restricted to the configured allowed directory
- **Scope**: This was an issue in example code, not the core library

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. This vulnerability was in the **example tools**, not the core SolidMCP library
2. The core library doesn't perform file operations - it's a framework
3. Users implementing their own tools should use similar path validation

## ‚úÖ Verification

Run security tests:
```bash
cargo test security_test
```

All tests pass, confirming the vulnerability is fixed.
