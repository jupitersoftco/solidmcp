# TODO-004: Dead Code Removal

**Status**: pending
**Priority**: critical
**Created**: 2025-07-30
**Updated**: 2025-07-30
**Assignee**: development-team
**Due Date**: 2025-08-02
**Tags**: dead-code, cleanup, maintenance, quick-fix
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days

## Description

The codebase contains dead code, primarily `src/server_old.rs`, that should be removed to improve maintainability and reduce confusion. Dead code can also pose security risks if it contains outdated patterns or vulnerabilities.

## Identified Dead Code

### Primary Target
- `src/server_old.rs` - Old server implementation that has been replaced

### Additional Dead Code Candidates
- Unused imports in various files
- Commented-out code blocks
- Unused functions and structs
- Unreachable code paths

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove `src/server_old.rs` completely
- [ ] Identify and remove unused imports across all files
- [ ] Remove commented-out code blocks (unless they serve as documentation)
- [ ] Remove unused functions, structs, and modules
- [ ] Verify no compilation errors after removal
- [ ] Ensure all tests still pass
- [ ] Update any documentation that references removed code

## Technical Implementation

### Analysis Commands
```bash
# Find unused code with cargo
cargo +nightly udeps

# Find unused imports
cargo clippy -- -W unused_imports

# Find dead code
cargo clippy -- -W dead_code

# Find unused variables
cargo clippy -- -W unused_variables
```

### Files to Review
- `src/server_old.rs` - Primary target for removal
- All `.rs` files for unused imports
- Test files for outdated test cases
- Documentation files for broken references

### Implementation Steps
1. **Immediate Removal**
   - Delete `src/server_old.rs`
   - Remove any references to it in `Cargo.toml` or `lib.rs`

2. **Systematic Cleanup**
   - Run cargo clippy to identify unused code
   - Remove unused imports file by file
   - Remove unused functions and structs
   - Clean up commented-out code blocks

3. **Verification**
   - Ensure compilation succeeds
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for any broken documentation links

## Code Analysis Results Expected

### Before Cleanup
```bash
$ cargo clippy -- -W dead_code
warning: function is never used: `old_function`
warning: struct is never used: `LegacyStruct`
warning: 5 warnings about unused imports
```

### After Cleanup
```bash
$ cargo clippy -- -W dead_code
# No warnings expected
```

## Dependencies
- Independent task
- Should be completed early to reduce codebase complexity

## Risk Assessment
- **Very Low Risk**: Removing unused code cannot break functionality
- **High Impact**: Improves code clarity and maintainability
- **Very Low Complexity**: Straightforward deletion and cleanup

## Benefits
- Reduced codebase size and complexity
- Improved compilation times
- Eliminated confusion from old implementations
- Better code navigation and understanding
- Reduced maintenance burden

## Verification Steps
1. **Pre-removal verification**
   ```bash
   cargo build --all-targets
   cargo test
   cargo clippy
   ```

2. **Post-removal verification**
   ```bash
   cargo build --all-targets
   cargo test
   cargo clippy -- -W dead_code -W unused_imports
   ```

3. **Documentation check**
   - Verify no broken links in README.md
   - Check CLAUDE.md for outdated references
   - Review any API documentation

## Progress Notes
- 2025-07-30: Dead code identified, ready for immediate removal
