# SolidMCP Code Quality Improvement Project

## Overview
This project tracks the systematic remediation of code smells identified in the comprehensive analysis of the SolidMCP Rust codebase. The tasks are organized by priority and structured to maintain development velocity while improving code quality.

## Active TODOs

### Critical Priority (Week 1 - Immediate Action Required)
- [TODO-001](TODO-001.md): **Memory Leak Fix** - Implement session cleanup and bounded storage
- [TODO-002](TODO-002.md): **Remove Artificial Performance Delays** - Eliminate 10-15ms HTTP response delays
- [TODO-003](TODO-003.md): **Security Vulnerabilities** - Fix session management and input validation
- [TODO-004](TODO-004.md): **Dead Code Removal** - Delete server_old.rs and unused code

### High Priority (Weeks 2-3 - Core Architecture)
- [TODO-005](TODO-005.md): **God Object Refactoring** - Split McpProtocolEngine responsibilities
- [TODO-006](TODO-006.md): **Global Lock Replacement** - Replace single mutex with fine-grained locking
- [TODO-007](TODO-007.md): **Large Method Extraction** - Break down 200+ line handle_message method
- [TODO-008](TODO-008.md): **Deadlock Prevention** - Fix lock-held-during-processing issues

### Medium Priority (Weeks 3-6 - Quality Improvements)
- [TODO-009](TODO-009.md): **Code Duplication Consolidation** - Centralize error handling and validation
- [TODO-010](TODO-010.md): **Tight Coupling Reduction** - Decouple framework and transport layers
- [TODO-011](TODO-011.md): **Type Safety Enhancement** - Replace string-typed with strong types
- [TODO-012](TODO-012.md): **Resource Leak Prevention** - Implement proper cleanup for all connections

### Low Priority (Weeks 6-8 - Polish & Maintenance)
- [TODO-013](TODO-013.md): **Naming Consistency** - Standardize naming conventions across codebase
- [TODO-014](TODO-014.md): **Logging Optimization** - Reduce excessive logging and improve efficiency

## Project Statistics
- **Total Active TODOs**: 14
- **Critical Priority**: 4
- **High Priority**: 4
- **Medium Priority**: 4
- **Low Priority**: 2

## Project Documents
- [**PROJECT_PLAN.md**](PROJECT_PLAN.md): Comprehensive 8-week project management plan
- Individual TODO items: TODO-001.md through TODO-014.md
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 45-60 developer days
- **Project Timeline**: 8 weeks (2025-07-30 to 2025-09-24)

## Progress Tracking
- **Project Started**: 2025-07-30
- **Current Phase**: Planning Complete - Ready for Week 1 Implementation
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-30
- **Next Review**: Weekly on Wednesdays

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Week 1 Priority**: Begin with TODO-002 (Remove Delays) - Quick win
2. **Critical Path**: TODO-001 → TODO-005 → TODO-009 (Memory → Architecture → Quality)
3. **Parallel Work**: TODO-003 (Security) can run alongside TODO-001
4. **Documentation**: Update progress notes in individual TODO files
