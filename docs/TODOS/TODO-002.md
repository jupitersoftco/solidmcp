# TODO-002: Remove Artificial Performance Delays

**Status**: pending
**Priority**: critical
**Created**: 2025-07-30
**Updated**: 2025-07-30
**Assignee**: development-team
**Due Date**: 2025-08-02
**Tags**: performance, artificial-delay, quick-fix
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days

## Description

The codebase contains artificial delays of 10-15ms added to HTTP responses, which significantly impacts performance. These delays appear to be added for testing or debugging purposes but have not been removed from production code.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. `tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10-15))` calls in HTTP response handling
2. Possibly added during debugging or testing phases
3. May be masking timing issues or race conditions
4. Unnecessary latency impacting user experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identify all artificial delay locations in the codebase
- [ ] Remove all `tokio::time::sleep` calls that are not functionally necessary
- [ ] Verify no timing-dependent functionality breaks after removal
- [ ] Add comments explaining any delays that must remain
- [ ] Measure performance improvement before/after
- [ ] Update any tests that may depend on these delays

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Search
- `src/http.rs` - HTTP response handling
- `src/websocket.rs` - WebSocket message processing  
- `src/shared.rs` - Protocol engine message routing
- `src/protocol_impl.rs` - Protocol implementation details

### Search Strategy
```bash
# Find all sleep/delay calls
rg "sleep|delay" --type rust
rg "Duration::from_millis" --type rust
rg "tokio::time" --type rust
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Audit all sleep/delay calls in the codebase
2. Categorize delays: artificial vs. functional
3. Remove artificial delays
4. Document any remaining delays with justification
5. Run performance benchmarks before/after
6. Update related tests if needed

## Dependencies
- Independent task - can be completed immediately
- May reveal underlying race conditions that need separate fixes

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Simple removal of unnecessary code
- **High Impact**: Immediate performance improvement
- **Low Complexity**: Straightforward search and replace

## Expected Performance Impact
- 10-15ms reduction in HTTP response latency
- Potential throughput improvement for concurrent requests
- Better user experience and lower resource utilization

## Testing Strategy
- Benchmark HTTP response times before/after
- Verify all existing tests still pass
- Add performance regression tests
- Monitor for any timing-related failures
